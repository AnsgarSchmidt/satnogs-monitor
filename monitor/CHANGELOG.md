## [Unreleased]
### Added
- command line parameter `--db-min` and `--db-max` to set the dB range of the
  spectrum and waterfall plot
- ui config options `db_min` and `db_max` to set the dB range of the spectrum
  and waterfall plot
- display current azimuth and elevation of the current observations vessel
- display rotator position if rotctld address is set
- command line parameter `--rotctld-address` to enable rotator monitoring
- config option `rotctld_address` to enable rotator monitoring

## [0.3.0] - 2019-12-02
### Added
- spectrum plot `--spectrum`
- waterfall widget `--waterfall` (requires a true color terminal emulator)
- Command line parameter `--data-path` to specify the satnogs-client data path

## [0.2.0] - 2019-10-07
### Added
- Command line parameter `-a|--api` to specify the SatNOGS network api endpoint.
- Polar plot
- Show satellite footprint on map.
- toggle satellite footprint with `f` key
- config option `sat_footprint` to enable/disable satellite footprint on start

### Changed
- Display as many future jobs as possible.
- Compiles on stable Rust.

### Fixed
- Typos
- Defaults for non essential config file entries.
- Background of the log window is cleared on display.

## [0.1.1] - 2018-11-18
### Added
- Command line parameter `-o|--orbit` which specifies how many orbits of the
  current satellite are plotted on the map.
 
### Changed
- Reduced SatNOGS API calls.
- Reduced CPU load and update satellite ground tracks only when orbit number
  has changed.
- Reduced used colors to base16 until themes have landed (to support hopefully
  all terminal emulators).

### Fixed
- Fix parse error when the station hasn't been seen by the network.
